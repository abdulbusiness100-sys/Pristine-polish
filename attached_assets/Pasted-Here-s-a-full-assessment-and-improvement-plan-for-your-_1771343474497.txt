Here’s a full assessment and improvement plan for your current website www.pristinepolish.co.uk (a Glasgow-based residential & commercial cleaning service) to maximise conversion, increase paying clients, and create a clear, persuasive customer journey. I’ve combined what’s currently on the site with proven best practices for high-converting cleaning service websites. ￼

⸻

✅ 1. First Impression & Value Proposition

What currently exists
	•	Headline simply states you provide high-quality cleaning services. ￼

Improvements

✔ Add a clear, benefit-driven hero headline above the fold, such as:

“Professional Cleaning That Gives You Back Your Time — Trusted, Local & Fully Tailored.”
This instantly communicates what you do + why it matters.

✔ Include a strong sub-headline detailing 2–3 key benefits:
	•	Fully insured & vetted team
	•	Flexible, tailored cleaning plans
	•	Same-day quotes available

✔ Primary Call-to-Action (CTA) above the fold:
👉 Get Your Free Quote Now
Make the button visually striking and sticky at all times (especially on mobile). ￼

⸻

✅ 2. Navigation & User Flow

Current
	•	Navigation links look generic and broad. ￼

Improvements

✔ Simplify navigation into clear conversion paths:
	•	Home
	•	Services
	•	Pricing
	•	Reviews / Testimonials
	•	Contact / Get a Quote

✔ Sticky top bar with click-to-call phone number on mobile – this drives immediate contact, especially for people searching on phones. ￼

⸻

✅ 3. Service Presentation & Clarity

Current
	•	Long tables with text description of services & add-ons. ￼

Improvements

✔ Break out services into visually engaging sections or cards:
	•	Regular Clean
	•	Deep Clean
	•	Commercial Clean
	•	Move-In / Move-Out
Each should have:
✔ Short benefit-focused descriptions
✔ Bullet points of what’s included
✔ Base pricing ranges
✔ Quick CTA (e.g., “Book This Service →”)

✔ Add a pricing section or tool so visitors can see what they might pay before contacting you. Transparency increases conversion. ￼

⸻

✅ 4. Testimonials & Trust Signals

Current
	•	Very limited social proof and no star reviews shown. ￼

Improvements

✔ Showcase real client reviews loudly on the homepage
Use:
⭐ Star ratings
✔ Multiple testimonials
✔ Location + service type with each review
✔ Video testimonials if possible
Social proof significantly increases trust in service based businesses. ￼

⸻

✅ 5. Visual Elements & Credibility

Current
	•	Mostly text-heavy service descriptions with no strong imagery. ￼

Improvements

✔ Add high-quality before & after images of actual jobs.
✔ Use image sliders or interactive comparisons so visitors can see the transformation (proven to boost conversions). ￼

✔ Add badges/credentials for:
	•	Insurance
	•	Staff background check & vetting
	•	Years in business
	•	Local affiliation

These build credibility instantly.

⸻

✅ 6. Lead Capture & CTAs

Improvements

✔ Add multiple, strategically placed CTAs
Examples:
	•	Free Quote Today
	•	Book an Appointment
	•	Schedule Your Clean in 3 Steps

Display them:
✔ In the hero section
✔ After each major service block
✔ In the footer

✔ Add a short booking/contact form on every page
Ask for minimal info (name, address, service type, best contact time) — shorter forms convert better. ￼

⸻

✅ 7. Landing Pages for Paid Traffic

If you’re running Google Ads / social ads, don’t send traffic to your homepage — send it to focused landing pages with:
	•	A bold headline matching the ad message
	•	A quick form and CTA
	•	Only relevant information (no distractions)
Focused landing pages can convert up to 10× better. ￼

⸻

✅ 8. Mobile & Performance Optimization
	•	People look for services on phones; slow or complex mobile pages lose leads. ￼
✔ Ensure mobile-first design:
• Large, tap-friendly buttons
• Quick load times (<3 seconds)
• Click-to-call functionality
• Simple menu

⸻

✅ 9. SEO & Traffic Growth

✔ Add structured local SEO information:
	•	Include Glasgow & surrounding neighbourhood names in content
	•	Add Google Business Profile integration
	•	Ensure contact info is consistent everywhere
This helps you rank better for local service searches. ￼

⸻

✅ 10. Content & Blog Strategy

Currently the site includes some generic blog posts, but you can expand this to:
	•	Tips for move-in/out cleaning
	•	Seasonal cleaning checklists
	•	How-to cleaning videos
Content builds search traffic and trust — visitors may bookmark and return.
